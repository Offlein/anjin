# Anjin: a game by Craig Leinoff
### Inspired by Lee & Mathias's "Shogun" for the Commodore 64. _(Further inspired by James Clavell's novel "Shogun".)_

Requirements
------------
This runs on Phaser v2.4.4. I've included it in the /lib directory. Probably I shouldn't do that... But I had to patch it.

You need Bower to include easystarjs v0.2.3 and whatever else I add.
Run `bower install`

You need TSD to include TypeScript definitions, if you want 'em.
Run `tsd install`

How To Play
-----------
Open the game in a webserver serving up index.html.

It isn't a game.

I know, sorry. It will be someday, I hope.
